# Simone Blanco Malerba, PhD 🦝
## About me
I like to understand complex systems with mathematical models and data analysis.
I am a physicist with variegate interdisciplinary interests, including electrical engineering ⚡️, machine learning 🤖, neuroscience 🧠, climate science 🌍 and biology 🧬.
I am currently a Marie-Curie fellow at the UKE, in Hamburg, studying the computational role of non-neuronal cells (astrocytes ⭐️) in neural systems.
