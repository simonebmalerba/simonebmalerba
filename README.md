# Simone Blanco Malerba, PhD ü¶ù
## About me
I like to understand complex systems with mathematical models and data analysis.
I am a physicist with variegate interdisciplinary interests, including engineering, machine learning, neuroscience, climate science and biology.

I am currently a Marie-Curie fellow at the UKE, in Hamburg, studying the computational role of non-neuronal cells (astrocytes) in neural systems, with models and tools from physics and machine learning.

Beside science, I am a cinema lover, and I have a set of random nerdy passions for history, linguistic and maps. I am a (poor) middle-long distance runner and I like to hike onto big rocks.
